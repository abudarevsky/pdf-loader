KNOWLEDGE GRAPH SERVICES,,,,,,,
This,section,outlines,how knowledge,"graphs,",once,"constructed,",ﬁnd use inside an enterprise. Most
enterprises have more than one reason to build a knowledge graph. Node representations from graph,,,,,,,
neural networks,,,trained on knowledge graphs,,can ﬁnd a,range of,internal use cases within a single
organization by powering multiple models that automate tasks. A knowledge graph for this use case is a,,,,,,,
feature store. On the other hand many use cases for knowledge graphs within an enterprise involve serving,,,,,,,
a portion of the graph via an API based on a search query along with any inferences produced by a model.,,,,,,,
Task Automation via Transfer Learning,,,,,,,
The novelty of graph machine learning in the form of graph neural networks is that,,,,,,,the representations it
produces are able to incorporate the context of a node’s surroundings in a network in an embedding for,,,,,,,
each node in the network. These node embeddings are a general purpose asset to drive machine learning,,,,,,,
applications within a company. Once the problem domain of the business that the knowledge graph models,,,,,,,
is understood in the right,,,"representation,",,task automation using these representations is a much simpler,,
"matter. This is how knowledge graphs can power a company in its transformation to Software 2.0, where its",,,,,,,
core assets are the models that automate its business processes rather than the source code that powers,,,,,,,
its services.,,,,,,,

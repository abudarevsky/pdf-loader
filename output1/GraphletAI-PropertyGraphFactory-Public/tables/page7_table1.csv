"Tools
for building Python classes for each domain’s application ontology are required to make ETL’ing"
"multiple bronze datasets into PySpark DataFrames or
tables in SnowFlake. Classes for each type in the"
ontology can be created from base classes provided by the system that use Python decorator functions to
deﬁne DataFrame or table schemas in a way that encourages code reuse.
Entity Resolution
"The
landmark
paper Deep
Entity Matching with
Pre-Trained Language Models deﬁned an encoding"
mechanism for semi-structured records and embedded these representations using Sentence Transformers
"to create vector
representations of entities for entity matching. This turns out
to be an excellent starting"
point as an encoding mechanism for many graph ML tasks. Matching code for entity resolution is available
"as part of
the papers’ authors’
implementation ditto. This sentence transformer vector encoding can be"
used for blocking and even matching via semantic similarity between structured records using cosine
"similarity with a threshold, although a diﬀerent model
is used for matching via a ﬁne-tuned classiﬁer in the"
ditto paper.

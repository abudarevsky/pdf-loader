"While most graphlet
and motif based learning perform searches for
the most signiﬁcant patterns in a"
"network,
there is a combinatorial problem with searching for graphlets or motifs with more than 5 nodes,"
and the complexity of graphlet searches over property graphs are not yet well deﬁned but are even more
complex once you factor in the use of properties.

Heterogenous Graphlets and their Minors,
Query languages for property graphs enable rich queries for network motifs incorporating both topology,
"and node and edge properties. However, without ﬁrst performing entity resolution, graph queries do not",
return good results because hopping across edges misﬁres due to duplicate nodes. This is especially the,
"case on datasets and knowledge graphs that are themselves made up of disparate sources of nodes, edges",
and their properties because there is heavy bias in what results and how many are returned.,I have seen
match counts for a motif search to be as much one million times more frequent after entity resolution is,
performed!,

vectors are simple to add to both Elastic 8 now that Lucene 9 supports ANN and OpenSearch supports

through the Lucene community. Elastic makes it easier to load"
data and handle a query workload while scaling in a linear manner. Either version of Elastic can now use
TF-IDF style search for matching or ANN and also rank and re-rank using vector matching. A property graph

for vectorizing search requests through a model management system like"
"MLFlow to incorporate them into queries against Elastic as it
takes a query vector to search with an index"

associated information retrieval.
Explainability via Network Visualization
"People do not act on predictions that
they don’t
trust. Without explainability or causal modeling, even"
"accurate predictions have limited utility in many domains. When working with knowledge graphs, network"
"visualization is an eﬀective way of visualizing explanations of predictions in a knowledge graph factory.
In"
"fact even without an explainable model, serving a prediction along with the subgraph of
its neighborhood"
provides rich context that can satisfy explainability requirements.

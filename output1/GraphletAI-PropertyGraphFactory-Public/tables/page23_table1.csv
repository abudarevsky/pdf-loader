and which
the
search
component of
the factory
sends
the API. For
smaller
scale,"
interactive network visualization Cambridge Intelligence oﬀers a system called Keylines that has a React
"wrapper
called ReGraph. ReGraph allows you to deﬁne rich interfaces in a simple manner using skills"
common among application developers such that expertise in network visualization is not required to build
interactive network visualizations.
"A property graph factory should have an API
layer
for search and information retrieval along with a web"
"interface for visualizing networks that
together enable application developers using the factory to produce"
"web and mobile apps that present and explain inferences and predictions in the business domain of
the"
end user.
PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

"The process deﬁned above is executed by many organizations in one variation or another.
It is never easy."
"The scale of
the data involved combined with frequent combinatorial scaling issues occurring with graphs."

"Once the ontology of
the application graph is deﬁned, the datasets making up the graph are transformed to"
match this ontology. Representation learning describes the network. These representations power models
"which add edges to the graph to create the type of
relations needed to solve a given problem. These"
models are applied to the network using batch inference with MLFlow.
Additional systems are needed to serve the edges to the graph that deﬁne our solution in the context of
"their local neighborhoods: a search engine, graph database, version ML APIs and a middleware API server."
The user of a knowledge graph factory should be able to point-click create the above diagram to serve that
knowledge graph via an API. The queries can then be eﬃciently deﬁned by the user and the system can
move into production eﬃciently.
